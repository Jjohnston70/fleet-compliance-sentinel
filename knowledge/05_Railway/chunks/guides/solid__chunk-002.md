### Deploy from a GitHub repo

To deploy a Solid app to Railway directly from GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a New Project on Railway**:
   - Go to [Railway](https://railway.com/new) to create a new project.
2. **Deploy from GitHub**:
   - Select **Deploy from GitHub repo** and choose your repository.
     - If your Railway account isn’t linked to GitHub yet, you’ll be prompted to do so.
3. **Deploy the App**:
   - Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.
   - Once deployed, a Railway [service](/services) will be created for your app, but it won’t be publicly accessible by default.
4. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Once the deployment completes, go to **View logs** to check if the server is running successfully.
5. **Set Up a Public URL**:
   - Navigate to the **Networking** section under the [Settings](/overview/the-basics#service-settings) tab of your new service.
   - Click [Generate Domain](/networking/public-networking#railway-provided-domain) to create a public URL for your app.
